### **Hi everyone** ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!!!

I have a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering with major in applied statistics from Universidad de los Andes (Colombia).

Currently, IÂ´m living in the US and I'm looking for a job in the field of Data Science like Data Analyst or Data Scientist. I moved here in 2020, and during the pandemic, IÂ´ve been focused on improving my skills in python programming, machine learning, SQL, Power BI through completing courses or tracks in DataCamp, watching Youtube videos, reading Blogs, etc.
